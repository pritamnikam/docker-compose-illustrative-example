# docker-compose-illustrative-example
This example illustrates Compose specification concepts with a concrete example application.

Consider an application split into a frontend web application and a backend service.

The frontend is configured at runtime with an HTTP configuration file managed by infrastructure, providing an external domain name, and an HTTPS server certificate injected by the platformâ€™s secured secret store.

The backend stores data in a persistent volume.

Both services communicate with each other on an isolated back-tier network, while frontend is also connected to a front-tier network and exposes port 443 for external usage.


(External user) --> 443 [frontend network]
                                |
                      +--------------------+
                      |  frontend service  |...ro...<HTTP configuration>
                      |      "webapp"      |...ro...<server certificate> #secured
                      +--------------------+
                                |
                        [backend network]
                                |
                      +--------------------+
                      |  backend service   |  r+w   ___________________
                      |     "database"     |=======( persistent volume )
                      +--------------------+        \_________________/


The example application is composed of the following parts:

- 2 services, backed by Docker images: webapp and database
- 1 secret (HTTPS certificate), injected into the frontend
- 1 configuration (HTTP), injected into the frontend
- 1 persistent volume, attached to the backend
- 2 networks
